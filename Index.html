                <h3>Bonfire Eveneing</h3>
                <p>Sitting around a crackling bonfire at night in a camp is a magical and atmospheric experience. The warm glow of the fire flickers against the darkness, 
                    casting dancing shadows on the faces of those gathered around.

                <h3>Try Fishing</h3>
                <p>Bait your hook, cast your line and see if you have any luck. 
                    In the end, it doesn't even matter if you catch a big one — you'll remember the conversations and the bonding time.

                <p>Find a trail, chart a course and go! Hiking gets your body moving and puts you out in nature, 
                    and basically embodies all the reasons to go camping in the first place

                <h3>Spot Constellations</h3>
                <p>You don't even need a telescope to try out some stargazing. 
                    If you're not practiced at identifying different planets and constellations, there are plenty of apps that can tell you what you're looking at — and many of them are even free.
